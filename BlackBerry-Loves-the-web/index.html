							<p>When considering enterprise app development on BlackBerry, we think there are two key areas to consider – firstly that enterprise apps have unique requirements and to treat enterprise app development as just another app project is to risk expensive failure, and secondly that web technology is, we think, likely to be the best approach for most enterprises.</p>
							<p>
								<b>Enterprise apps:</b><br>
								Firstly, enterprise apps are not the same as consumer apps.  There are a number of important considerations which can make the difference between a successful enterprise app deployment and a failure.  We refer to these as the fundamentals of enterprise app development on mobile:
							</p>
							<p><b>First</b> is <b>behind the firewall access</b>.  Most enterprise apps need to communicate with business software running behind the firewall in order to function properly – this applies across a range of app use cases from expenses or vacation approval apps to accessing financial or customer (CRM) data to applications specific to a role such as field service or customer services applications.  While many app developers focus on the on-device end-user experience, this is all wasted effort if due consideration isn’t given to the way in which the app on device communications with the software behind the firewall.  BlackBerry 10 and BES 10 make this easy – the communications links between the device and the environment behind the firewall is available by default on BlackBerry and developers don’t have to worry about issues such as security, port access, connectivity protocols etc.</p>
							<p><b>Second</b> is <b>push communications</b>.  By design, the BlackBerry model is for data to be pushed on an event-driven basis to devices.  For the end-user, this means two things – not having to wait for time-sensitive information and being able to work in an offline mode based on the most recent information available when the device went out of connectivity.</p>
							<p><b>Third</b> is <b>app management and distribution</b>.  As discussed earlier, BlackBerry enables administrators to manage enterprise apps and the catalogue of apps available to end-users, either as mandatory or optional.  End-users are able to easily see pre-approved and recommended apps as well as be confident that all mandatory apps will be proactively pushed out to their devices.</p>
							<p><b>The second key area</b> is the use of web technology for building apps.   This provides enterprises with a number of key advantages:</p>
							<p><b>Firstly</b> – building existing or new apps using HTML 5 (i.e. Web), will mean those apps work on the existing estate of BlackBerry devices (OS 5, 6 and 7) as well as on BlackBerry 10 devices.</p>
							<p><b>Secondly</b>, HTML 5 provides the most efficient cross-platform approach – apps built in HTML 5 can be used across al the major smartphone platforms with the least amount of change additional coding requiring (note to speaker: it’s NOT the case that you only need to write once; but by building an app in Web you can use the same core code base and then modify for the different platforms)</p>
							<p><b>Thirdly</b> – web development skills are widely available for the ‘desktop’ and mobile world and so specialist skills to develop in Java or other native mobile OS environments aren’t needed – this makes for lower cost app development.  There are also numerous tools available to make building mobile apps in web technology even easier – these include Sencha, Jqeury and others</p>
							<p><b>Last</b> but not least, with WebWorks (supported on both BlackBerry 10 and BlackBerry OS) we have an extremely powerful tool to enable web apps to integrate tightly with the core OS, making “web” apps look, feel and perform like “native” apps.</p>
							<p>So, by focusing app development on web technology we think enterprise have the most efficient and most future-proof way of building new and existing apps on BlackBerry 10 and of providing end-users or end-customers with an amazing app experiences.</p>

							<p>With BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 and Balance we also deliver the capabilities for enterprises to deploy, manage and secure applications through a corporate app storefront. This capability is built-in to the platform and all the IT admin needs to do is enable Balance. BlackBerry World for Work allows businesses to push mandatory applications as well as curate their own bespoke corporate app store so users can browse and download apps that have been vetted and approved by their company, into their secure work space. At the same time, users can still access BlackBerry World to find, download and share the apps, games, music and video content they want – without compromise and with full privacy.</p>
							<p>With BlackBerry Balance, not only do enterprises gain the ability to manage devices and apply security controls, but they also gain comprehensive and flexible application management capabilities – and all delivered through the one unified BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 console.</p>
